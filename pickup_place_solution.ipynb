        "Tokyo is one of the most visted city in the world. **About 14.24 milliion trvelers visted Tokyo in the last year**, for tour, business, shopping, study or else. As a resident of the city, I noticed a new boom in travelers, explosive buying, means they like to buy a lot of duty-free goods - almost fill 1 or 2 big suitcase - more than sighseeing. \n",

        "**How to pick up goods purchased before competitors get it?** It is a bussiness problem that delivery companys have to solve.\n",

        "Our idea is that set some pick up places near by travelers activty route. It is may be in shops, in hotels, or in airports etc. Since the group tour travelers will back to their motorcoach afetr shopping, we consider the better places will be between shopping area and parking space. **Therefore, the business problem can be solved as below**  \n",
